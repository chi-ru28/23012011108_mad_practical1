<br>1.5.	Display Month Name: Use a when expression to display the month name based on user input.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Use the when expression (Kotlin’s version of switch) to print the month name based on the user’s number input (1 → January, 2 → February, etc.).<br>
<b>Purpose:</b> Understands how to use when expressions for multiple conditions.<br>

<br>1.6.	User-Defined Function: Create a user-defined function to perform arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on two numbers<br>
<b>Description:</b> Define a function that accepts two numbers and performs arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Call the function and display results.<br>
<b>Purpose:</b> Teaches how to create and use functions in Kotlin.<br>

<br>1.8.	Working with Arrays: Explore array operations such as Arrays.deepToString(), contentDeepToString(), IntArray.joinToString(), and use them to print arrays. Utilize various loop types like range, downTo, until, etc., to manipulate arrays. Sort an array of integers both without using built-in functions and with built-in functions.<br>
<b>Description:</b> Explore array functions like Arrays.deepToString(), contentDeepToString(), IntArray.joinToString(). Work with different loops (for, downTo, until, range) to print and manipulate arrays. Also, write code to sort arrays:<br>
Without built-in functions (manual sorting)<br>
With built-in functions like .sortedArray()<br>
<b>Purpose:</b> Understands arrays and loops, along with sorting techniques.<br>
